\subsection{Problem Background}  % 二级标题

Deep-sea submersible is an important ocean engineering equipment for deep-sea development and utilization, and also provides people with an opportunity for ocean sightseeing. However, some seabed terrain is complex and ocean currents are strongly disturbed\cite{KJRB202306260042}, so before using a submersible to lead visitors to explore, safety procedures need to be developed to monitor the situation in the submersible, maintain communication with the owner and detect possible machine failures.

The loss of contact of the Titanic deep-sea submersible in 2023 caused an increase in the demand for submersible safety issues. The submersible oxygen reserve should be sufficient, the power system should be stable, and an effective backup system is also necessary \cite{Kirin}. The outside world needs to predict the position of the submersible over time and be able to find the missing submersible in the shortest possible time.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

Considering the background information and restricted conditions identified in the problem statement, we need to solve the following problems:
\begin{itemize}  % 无序列表

\item\textbf{Problem 1 }Build a model to predict the position of the submersible over time and account for uncertainties.


\item\textbf{Problem 2 }Advise the company on what search equipment to carry on the main ship and consider the availability, maintenance and cost of the equipment.

\item\textbf{Problem 3 }Build a model that uses the model information from question 1 to recommend equipment deployment patterns, the shortest time to find a missing submersible, and determine the probability of the submersible as a function of time and cumulative search results.

\item\textbf{Problem 4 }Consider how the model, extended to other tourist destinations such as the Caribbean, would need to change to account for multiple vehicles moving in the same region.

\subsection{Our Work}

\section{Assumptions and Justifications}

In order to solve the issues effectively,the following reasonable assumptions are formulated:
\begin{itemize}  % 无序列表

\item\textbf{Assumption 1 }
Seawater density is assumed to be linearly associated with depth.
\textbf{Justification :}\ \ Due to the differences in temperature and salinity, the phenomenon of vertical density stratification widely exists in the Marine environment. We can think that the submarine moves in this dense cline stratified by vertical density, and the density of the seawater, namely its depth, is linearly related.

\item\textbf{Assumption 2 }
Suppose that the submarine can be approximately regarded as a cylinder during the seabed movement.\\
\textbf{Justification : }
SUBOFF submarine model, as a scientific research submarine model, only has a few surface peripherals such as tail paddle. Compared with the size of the overall shape of the submarine, so SUBOFF can be regarded as the main body with only cylindrical submarine.
\item\textbf{Assumption 3 }
Assume that the surface of the submersible in contact with water is approximately smooth.\\
\textbf{Justification : }
Tourist submersibles have high safety performance requirements and are regularly maintained, with rare attachments or damages on their surface. Additionally, their surface is coated with a special material resistant to high pressure. According to Prandtl's theory of turbulent boundary layers, the surface of the submersible moving relative to the surrounding seawater can be considered approximately smooth. 
\item\textbf{Assumption 4 }
When extending the model to tourist destinations in the fourth question, all types of submarines for recreational diving must be deployed, and the main ship seeks to maximize profits while ensuring safety.\\
\textbf{Justification : }
 Based on ensuring safety, effective resource allocation, and optimizing operational strategies can enhance service efficiency and increase revenue. This assumption aligns with the fundamental principles and practical requirements of operating recreational facilities.

\section{Model 1:Best search model  }% 一级标题
 

%\textit{Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)} is utilized as the primary methodology for this comprehensive analysis.  % 斜体

%\textbf{Environmental impacts} assessed in this study include global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential.  % 粗体

%\underline{Sustainable strategies} for reducing the environmental impact of single-use plastics are proposed, based on the findings of the LCA.  % 下划线


\subsection{Preparation of the model}  % 二级标题
In our model, we need to consider the analysis of multiple modes of the submersible and its force situation, using some parameters of the submersible in the specific calculation, so we take the SUBOFF submarine model as the research object. Model parameters are as in Table 2 and the 3 D model is shown in Figure X.
